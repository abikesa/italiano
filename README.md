Ah, yes! 🥗 **Insalata** (salad)—an oft-misunderstood course, especially outside Italy.

In *true Italian dining tradition*, **insalata is usually served after the secondo**, **alongside or after the contorno**. Why? To **refresh the palate** and **aid digestion**—not to bulk up the beginning of the meal like in the American style.

So let's **precisely integrate it** into the refined structure:

---

1. 🥂 **Aperitivo** – Pre-meal drink & small bites  
2. 🧀 **Antipasto** – Appetizers (cheeses, cured meats, etc.)  
3. 🍝 **Primo** – First course (pasta, risotto, soup)  
4. 🍖 **Secondo** – Main dish (meat or fish)  
5. 🥗 **Contorno** – Side dish (vegetables, legumes)  
6. 🥬 **Insalata** – Salad (light, bitter greens, served *after* the main dish)  
7. 🧀 **Formaggi** – Cheese course (optional, often regional)  
8. 🍰 **Dolce** – Dessert  
9. ☕ **Caffè** – Espresso, strong and unsweetened  
10. 🍷 **Digestivo** – After-dinner liqueur (grappa, amaro, etc.)

---

🫓 **Pane** – Ubiquitous, wordless, loyal—from antipasto to secondo.

So yes—**insalata deserves its own line**. It's a crisp epilogue to the savory drama of the main, and in some ways, it’s the *pause* before the final indulgence.
